%%%%%    this is a readme file which means you   %%%%%
%%%%%       should probably pay attention!       %%%%%
%%%%%  you need everything in this folder to be  %%%%%
%%%%%  in your directory if you want to use the  %%%%%
%%%%% style file (besides the readme, of course) %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% some stuff you can use: 
% NOTE: BASICALLY EVERY ENVIRONMENT HAS ITS OWN COLOR! PLEASE CHECK THEM ALL OUT :D :D 

\prob{Source}{Problem}

\begin{question}{(source)} % must use parentheses around the source! also replace question with theorem and definition. 
% Problem
\end{question}

\begin{proofX} % replace X with either A,C,G,N. 
% Red solution environment % A = red; C=yellow; G=green; N=blue
\end{proofX}
% replace proof with lemma or claim
% end lemma with \endlem for empty square and end proof with \endpro or \endsol for blacksquare at the end of line


% you can stack environments, as usual! how cool
% as a helpful nudge, i have provided a starter tex file in this repository under the name "starter.tex"

%%%%% probably tell by visual similarities :) %%%%%
%%%%%  by the way, i hope what i'm doing does %%%%%
%%%%%             indeed work :)              %%%%%
