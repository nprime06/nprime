%credits to dennis chen, who basically created this sty (with modifications by myself) and you can probably tell by visual similarities :)
%will consider adding other environments such as theorem, etc. as of yet the style file is for personal use so problem and solution environments will suffice
%some stuff you can use: 

\prob{Source}{Problem}

\begin{question}{(source)} % must use parentheses around the source!
% Problem
\end{question}

\begin{proofX} % replace X with either A,C,G,N. 
% Red solution environment % A = red; C=yellow; G=green; N=blue
\end{proofX}
% replace proof with lemma or claim
% end lemma with \endlem for empty square and end proof with \endpro or \endsol for blacksquare at the end of line


% you can put environments like itemize, lemmaX, etc. inside the proofX environments! how cool

% by the way, i dont really know what im doing :)
